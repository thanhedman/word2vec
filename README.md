word2vec in go lang

Original documentation is here: https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/

This is a fork from github.com/sshillo/word2vec, which seems to have been written to load and run queries against a trained model.

The purpose of this fork learning, so it's essentially a reimplementation of the training portion in Go.
